                                    it's just awful to write this stuff and i hate having to sell myself or make myself seem like some amazing superhuman. i have some generic interests, im a bit shy, and i dont play games and just want be there for a girl and make her feel like the most unique and special person, so this is one of the most annoying experiences ever. i dont even know why i bother with this stuff when everyone is basically selling themselves as an idealized superman and I just want girls to know who I am and they can take or leave it.
